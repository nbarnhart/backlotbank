                        Backlot Bank was started in reaction to a problem that many in the entertainment industry
                        experience: liquidity. Residuals are an important part of the hollywood ecosystem and make
                        it possible for directors, writers, and actors to be fairly compensated. However, residuals are
                        also extremely unpredictable and not always available when you need them. Our mission is to give talent
                        the option to invest their future residuals in whatever is important to them now.
