Thank you for purchasing our theme. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file, please feel free to email. Thanks so much!

There is nothing special to mention in here. The only thing that I want to mention is that as you've seen in the demo there are six different options for the timer / countdown plugin. You can change it to circle, border-left, border-right etc. 
	
	To change timer styles you need to find a class 'timer' and add a class that you like and remove the old class. 

	for example: from 'no-border' to 'circle'.
	Please note that if you forget to remove the old class it may not look good.


Change main styles.css file to any provided colors stylesheet. All the styles are located in the directory 'css'.
